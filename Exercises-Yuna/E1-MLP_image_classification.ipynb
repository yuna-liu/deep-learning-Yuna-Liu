    "As we know from the lectures, there are no certain mathematical rules for choosing number of nodes and hidden layers. What we can do is to do trial and error, but it would be expensive to not have any guidelines. Look at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqBRET7tbiQ) and this [blog article ](https://towardsdatascience.com/17-rules-of-thumb-for-building-a-neural-network-93356f9930af) for rule of thumbs. Note that this will be computationally expensive on your laptop for larger networks and higher resolution images. Log in to kaggle and create a jupyter notebook inside kaggle and enable GPU. Remember to shut off the GPU after you're done with your work, you get a certain amount of quotas every week. \n",
